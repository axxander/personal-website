### Overview

- I used this project to learn about:
  - Continuous integration and continuous deployment using GitHub workflows
  - Docker
  - GCP Cloud Run
  - Automated testing using Jest and Supertest for Express applications

### Future

- Build personal website using this as the server
- Write more specific workflows for developing off the main branch & handling pull requests
- Use a frontend framework (likely React) to improve frontend skills beyond vanilla JS
